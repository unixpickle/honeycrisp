# ``Tensor/cumulativeProd(axis:exclusive:reverse:function:file:line:)``

Compute a cumulative product along an axis.

## Overview

If `reverse` is true, accumulate from the right instead of from the left.

If `exclusive` is true, then the product is shifted by 1, and the value `1.0` is inserted inserted in the first result's place.
